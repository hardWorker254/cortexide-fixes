CortexIDE is the open-source Cursor alternative.

Use AI agents on your codebase, checkpoint and visualize changes, and bring any model or host locally. CortexIDE sends messages directly to providers without retaining your data.

This repo contains the full sourcecode for CortexIDE. If you're new, welcome!
